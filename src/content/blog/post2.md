I am thrilled to introduce you to my latest creation: BurnIt, the ultimate mobile chatbot that helps you stay on track with your health and fitness goals! 📱💪🥗

This little guy tracks your daily physical activity and calorie intake and gives you personalized recommendations to help you achieve your best self! And let me tell you, this app is loaded with cutting-edge technology! I used React Native with Redux for optimized state management, Firebase for authentication, and the Nutritionix NLP API to calculate calorie intake and outtake. Oh, and let's not forget about the ChatGPT gpt-3.5-turbo API, which provides natural language processing for personalized recommendations 🔍🤖🔥

But that's not all! Users can log in with their social media account and choose to display data from the last 7 or 30 days on the home screen. The line chart visualizes their calorie intake and outtake over time, and I've used the ChatGPT API to generate personalized suggestions based on user's meals and physical activity data.

And speaking of logging meals and exercise, BurnIt has got that covered too!  For instance, users can say, "For lunch, I had a burger, noodle, Coke, chips, and two slices of bacon" and the app will calculate the calorie intake using Nutritionix NLP API. Similarly, users can enter their exercise like "I ran for 2 miles and walked for 1 hour" and the app will track their calorie outtake. 🏃‍♀️🥤🥓

But, you know, the driving force behind this app was my desire to develop a tool that could positively impact people's lives. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm proud of it.
