Hey everyone! Nathanael Tjen and I have been busy with an amazing project, HeartBeat (https://heartbeatnurse.vercel.app/). We've set up CI/CD pipelines for both the frontend and backend, which has been an awesome learning experience.

In the spirit of sharing knowledge, I've put together a tutorial explaining how we set this up using Django, PostgreSQL, and AWS. This step-by-step guide is filled with our key learnings and experiences.

Check it out(https://medium.com/@quanjingchen/tutorial-setting-up-a-ci-cd-pipeline-for-a-django-and-postgresql-project-on-aws-ec2-5671701ce828?source=social.linkedin). I hope you find it useful! And if you have any thoughts or questions, feel free to reach out to me at quanjingchen@gmail.com.
